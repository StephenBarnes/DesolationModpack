Version: 0.5.0
Date: 29. 08. 2024
  Features:
    - TODO Added custom terrain gen for trees, enemy nests, and gem-bearing boulders.
    - TODO Analyzed and tweaked turrets. Nerfed flamethrower turrets because they trivialise defense. (?)
    - Analyzed and tweaked loaders, bundlers, inserters, and packers. Loaders (except steam) now require lubricant, so that there's a reason to use fast and stack inserters. Adjusted fuel consumption, tech progression, and descriptions.
    - Analyzed and tweaked mining drills. Advanced mining drills now have higher output rate than small electric drills, per occupied tile.
    - Analyzed and tweaked paving material costs and speeds. All paving options now have roughly equal material costs.
    - Tweaked barrels. Increased barrel fluid contents 10x, to compensate for 10x smaller ship/train inventories (to balance containerization). Added barrel disassembly recipe, analogous to container disassembly.
    - Tweaked furnaces. Moved arc furnace to earlier (after chrome and cryogenics, instead of after blue circuits). Stone furnaces are slightly slower, so that bronze furnaces are superior.
    - Improved icons for robotics techs.
  Changes:
    - Adjusted speeds and energy consumption of many machines to make numbers more rounded (e.g. crafting speed 0.625 changed to speed 0.5).
    - Gold requires water for mining.
    - Adjusted names and descriptions of many technologies.
    - Container disassembly now conserves iron ingots on average.
    - Made dependency on Harder Basic Logistics optional. If enabled, it will only remove long inserters and shorten undergrounds.
    - Added Better Victory Screen mod as dependency, and added compatibility with it.
    - For IR3's casting machines, synchronized animation speed, recipes, and sound.
    - Other minor changes and tweaks.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash caused by interaction of pylons and powered pumps.
    - Fixed victory when opening the IR3 manifesto (due to the simulation team getting all techs researched).

Version: 0.4.0
Date: 22. 08. 2024
  Changes:
    - Moved electric arc turrets and electric discharge equipment to early electric age.
    - Pylons are now late-game and can cross cold tiles. Tweaks to other electric poles. Wooden poles removed completely.
    - Tuned terrain generation and resource placement. Starting island warm patches are larger.
    - Moved ambient heat exchanger and polluted water filtration machines and recipes to geothermal tech and fluid handling tech, to make geothermal practical earlier.
    - Removed solar panels and solar panel equipment. Added solar subassembly intermediate for satellites.
    - Shortened underground belts to length 1. Added dependency on Harder Basic Logistics to de-duplicate code.
    - Iron burner ice melter can consume barrels and canisters of liquid fuel.
    - Removed glass bottle, pending possible science rework.

Version: 0.3.0
Date: 16. 08. 2024
  Features:
    - Added Long-Range Delivery Drones mod and tweaks.
    - Added Beacon Rebalance mod and tweaks. Basic beacon available in the early game.
    - Fine-tuned terrain generation and resource placement. Starting island resources are more predictable.
  Bugfixes:
    - Quantum labs now accept elixir stone.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 16. 08. 2024
  Features:
    - Added endgame technologies: magnum opus, cosmic reckoning, long-range transmaterialisation.
    - Victory when final tech is researched.
    - Added transmutation recipes for ore amplification using elixir stones.
    - Vehicle inventory sizes changed for better integration with Intermodal Containers.
    - Added container-packing for many more items.
  Changes:
    - Removed telemetry unit item.
    - Tweaked vehicle movement parameters and fuel types.
    - Force-set and hide other mod settings, instead of only changing defaults.
  Bugfixes:
    - Improved auto-debugger, and fixed progression bugs found by auto-debugger.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 12. 08. 2024
  Features:
    - Custom terrain generation and resource placement.
    - Building restricted to warm patches.
    - Seismic scanner, ocean scanner, and starting island scan.
    - Evolution depends on milestone techs researched.
    - Auto-debugger script.
    - Stone and ice byproducts from mining. Ice melter machines (using IR3 sprites).
    - Integration with other mods: Industrial Revolution 3 and addons, Alien Biomes, BREAM, Clockwork, Intermodal Containers, Cargo Ships, Searchlight Assault, Production Scrap, and others.
  Minor Features:
    - Stack size groups.
    - Brick and concrete walls (using IR3 sprites).
    - Offshore pumps require power.
    - Disabled long inserters.
