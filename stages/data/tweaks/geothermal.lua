-- Perhaps we should make geothermal energy available much earlier?
-- TODO

-- Should we buff geothermal energy? Because I like the design challenges of trying to build outposts close to geothermal vents.
-- Note polluted steam vents seem to produce between 120/sec polluted steam and zero. When they deplete, they get re-set to 100% -- see replenish_fissure function in control.lua.
-- For one steam vent producing on average 60/sec polluted steam, that supplies ~1 geothermal exchanger, which supplies ~2 electric engines, producing ~2MW, so ~4 electric mining drills. Assuming we filter or vent all of the polluted water.
-- Note polluted steam vents sometimes come in clumps of like 3, which would be 6MW, so 12 electric mining drills.
-- All of this is just not enough power to be relevant.
-- TODO buff them.
