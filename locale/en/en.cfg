[technology-description]
; Adding unique descriptions to some tiered techs that re-use the same strings.
ir-concrete-1=Concrete is a cheap material useful for paving, walls, and industrial buildings. As a paving material, it allows faster walking than stone brick paths, at a roughly equivalent resource cost.
ir-concrete-2=By treating concrete with sulphur and reinforcing it with steel, you can produce a paving material that allows noticeably faster walking than ordinary concrete, while keeping roughly the same material cost.
ir-ethanol-1=Process wood chips to produce a clean light alcohol. Ethanol is a useful fuel source, and later provides an alternate means to produce plastic and rubber.
ir-ethanol-2=Synthesize ethanol from natural gas, instead of wood chips.
plastics-2=Using ethanol, you can produce synthetic rubber, and you can produce plastics without petroleum.
ir-copper-working-2=More complex copper components, and some applications.
ir-grinding-2=Electric crushers capable of crushing iron ore, as well as electric mixers that will be useful later for producing concrete, landfill, tarmac, and graphite.
ir-electronics-2=Using new materials like gold, silicon, plastic, and steel, you can produce more advanced circuits and machines.
ir-electronics-3=Using new materials like electrum, nanoglass, and chrome, you can produce more advanced circuits and machines.
ir-modules-2=Using your improved electronics, you can produce more powerful modules.
ir-modules-3=Using your improved electronics, you can produce more powerful modules.
ir-washing-2=Using hot water, you can increase the yields of secondary minerals. By balancing both types of ore washing, you can balance mineral yields to ensure your production lines don't get clogged.
ir-arc-furnace-2=Recipes to smelt molten steel from iron and hydrogen, instead of iron and coke.
laser=The creation of pulses of coherent light. Sadly, they are mostly useful for manufacturing, and are not strong enough to kill anything yet. That comes later.
laser-2=Lasers strong enough to kill. They're also useful for space mining.
ir-mining-1=Compared to the steam-powered miner, the electric mining drill has the same power consumption and pollution, per item produced. However, it produces twice as many items per second, and can take a fluid input, allowing it to mine gold using water, and uranium using sulphuric acid. It mines from a larger area than the steam miner, but takes up the same amount of space.
ir-mining-2=Compared to the smaller electric drill, the advanced mining drill produces double as many items per occupied tile, despite taking up more space. It also has 25% lower energy consumption and pollution per item produced.
ir-research-1=Laboratories capable of using more advanced analysis packs.
ir-research-2=Laboratories capable of using all analysis packs.
; For loaders and bundlers
ir3-loader-steam=Loaders can rapidly fill or empty containers, vehicles, and machines, by connecting them directly to a yellow belt. Bundlers can quadruple belt throughput for ingots and other brick-like items, by bundling them together into sets of 4.
bulk-logistics=Lubricated loaders to quickly load and unload containers, vehicles, and machines. Electric bundlers to quadruple belt throughput.

; Misc
ir-bronze-furnace=Sturdier materials allow for hotter furnaces, and a tougher vehicle.
optics=Various devices to fend off the darkness.
ir-radar=Use radio waves to continuously monitor your factory and scan the surrounding area.
seismic-scanner=By using explosive charges to create seismic waves, and monitoring the reflections of these waves, entire landmasses can be mapped from a single point.
ocean-scanner=Sonar-emitting pods which can be dropped into deep water to chart the surrounding ocean, outlining landmasses to explore further.
landfill=Shape the coastline to make ports for ships. Landfill can only be placed on shallow or muddy water. Waterfill explosives can only be placed on non-frigid land next to water, and will explode to create muddy water.
meat:steam-locomotion-technology=Large-scale transportation over long distances. Railways and signals can be built on frigid terrain.
railway=Advanced steel locomotives accelerate faster than the iron locomotive, with better fuel efficiency, and can use a wider variety of fuels.
ironclad=With naval artillery, enemy nests can be besieged from the sea.
	; Alpha Centauri reference
water_transport=This appears to be a water planet, and it can be ruled from the waves.
ir-inserters-1=As well as electric inserters, this technology unlocks packing machines and containers, which can vastly increase the throughput of trains, ships, and transport belts.
concrete-wall=With reinforced concrete, you can mass-produce fortifications that are both stronger and cheaper than brick walls.
ir-steel-wall=Where concrete walls are insufficient, you can spend extra resources to build something more durable. Maybe the biters will pay for it.
searchlight-assault=Searchlights cast a bright beam of light that searches the surrounding area. When an enemy is found, autogun turrets adjacent to the searchlight will receive a large temporary bonus to their range, allowing them to snipe the spotted enemy from afar.
ir-transmat=Teleporters, allowing you to travel vast distances in mere moments. Unfortunately, their maximum range is limited to this planet and its solar system. To get home to Earth, you'll need to teleport yourself across the entire galaxy, using a more powerful device...
magnum-opus=Two spirits are contained in a third hidden thing.
cosmic-reckoning=By studying the star data collected by your satellites, you can pinpoint the position of Earth in the night sky.
long-range-transmaterialisation=With the elixir stone, the range of your transmaterialisers can be boosted to intergalactic distances. Finally, you can return to Earth!
telemetry=Gathering and processing geographic data, useful for mapping and navigation.
automobilism=Versatile vehicle for personal transportation and assaulting enemy nests. Fuelled by barrels or canisters of liquid fuel.
ir-hydrogen-airship=Chocks away! A flying vehicle for automated transportation over both land and sea.
ir-helium-airship=An upgrade to the hydrogen airship, featuring a larger cargo hold and more nimble movement.
ir-heavy-picket=Using force-field technology, the old heavy roller design can be upgraded to allow near-frictionless travel over land and sea. The Fieldglider is capable of very fast transportation over long distances, and its large equipment grid and inventory size make it the ideal mobile construction platform for rapidly setting up outposts.
automated_water_transport=Cargo ships for bulk transportation of cargo over water. Allows creating waterways using the shortcut button or __CONTROL__give-waterway__. Ports and signal buoys can be built on waterways to create automated shipping routes.
long-range-delivery-drone=Use drones to deliver cargo to distant locations. Each drone carries up to 5 stacks of cargo. Drones are expended after a single delivery, making them useful for initial outpost construction but too expensive for ongoing bulk shipping.
ir-medical-pack=For some strange reason, the fish on this planet don't have magical healing properties. You'll have to make do with medical packs instead.
ir-steel-milestone=More advanced steel components and applications, including a new science pack, cheaper electric poles, and a bigger storage chest.
ir-geothermal-exchange=Use scalding polluted steam from geothermal vents to boil clean water. A full geothermal setup (including geothermal exchangers, polluted water cleaners, and a source of additional clean water) can be expected to produce on average around 1.5MW of net electric power per fissure, fluctuating between zero and 3MW. The main advantage of geothermal energy is in simplifying logistics, as power can be generated locally, without needing to import fuel or energy-storing items.
; Fluid techs
fluid-handling=Tanks and pumps to store and move fluids. Iron canisters hold more steam than copper cells, and the electric filling station can fill canisters twice as fast.
ir-barrelling=Barrels are the fluid equivalent of containers. In the Desolation modpack, there are no fluid trains or tankers, so barrels are indispensable.
; For electric pole revamp
advanced-electric-distribution=The null field has some unexpected applications in cloaking electrical fields, allowing your power networks to cross rough terrain without rousing the natives. Pylons can be built on cold tiles and are ignored by enemies. Substations provide energy to a large area.
ir-electrum-milestone=Using specially-prepared sheets of electrum, the null field can be shaped and manipulated to achieve a variety of effects.
; For beacon rebalance
effect-transmission=Beacons transmit the effects of modules to nearby machines. However, a machine can only be boosted by one beacon, otherwise it will become overloaded and stop working. Beacons can take speed or efficiency modules, but not productivity modules. The basic beacon has 2 module slots and a 7x7 area of effect, and transmits the effects of its modules at 50% strength.
effect-transmission-2=An upgrade to the basic beacon, with the same number of module slots (2) but double the effect strength (100%), and a larger area of effect (13x13). A machine can only be boosted by one beacon, otherwise it will become overloaded and stop working.

[entity-description]
pit=A deep hole in the ground. Can be used to dispose of scrap, ice, stone, gravel, sand, or wood chips.
steel-cleaner=Filters polluted water to produce a slightly reduced volume of clean water. Builds up gunge in the form of gravel, sand, and sulphur, which must be removed or they will eventually block the filter.
steel-boiler=Uses electricity to heat water, producing hot water or steam. Use __CONTROL__ir-entity-adjustment__ to toggle between hot water and steam output. When producing steam from cold water, the machine is 90% efficient, so the produced steam will contain 90% of the input electric energy.
stone-charcoal-kiln=A slow-burning kiln that converts wood chips into charcoal. Does not require additional fuel. Every minute, a charcoal kiln can turn 60 wood chips into 30 charcoal, doubling the total fuel value and halving the fuel pollution.
iron-gas-vent=Releases gases into the atmosphere, at a rate of 20 gas per second. Cannot vent liquids. Produces pollution depending on the gas: 12/m for [fluid=ammonia-gas] ammonia and [fluid=sulphur-gas] sour gas; 6/m for [fluid=fossil-gas] fossil gas and [fluid=natural-gas] natural gas; 3/m for [fluid=carbon-gas] carbon dioxide and [fluid=dirty-steam] polluted steam; and zero pollution for [fluid=steam] steam, [fluid=oxygen-gas] oxygen, [fluid=nitrogen-gas] nitrogen, [fluid=air-gas] compressed air, [fluid=hydrogen-gas] hydrogen, and [fluid=helium-gas] helium.
air-purifier=Filters the local atmosphere, reducing pollution at the cost of air filters. One air purifier is exactly equivalent to an air compressor plus 4 gas vents to get rid of the compressed air; the only difference is slightly lower energy consumption.

; Forestries - I want descriptions to explain how much wood they make, etc.
bronze-forestry=Slowly produces wood from water, and also cleans the air. No power required. Every 24 seconds, a bronze forestry will consume 15 to 30 water, and produce up to 1 wood item, with a probability ranging from 0% to 100%. This probability, and the amount of water consumed, depend on how many living trees (natural or artificial) are in the same chunk, up to a maximum of 50 trees. There is no benefit to placing multiple forestries in the same chunk.
iron-forestry=Twice as fast as a bronze forestry, but requires electricity. Produces wood from water, and also cleans the air. Every 12 seconds, an iron forestry will consume 15 to 30 water to produce up to 1 wood item, with a probability ranging from 0% to 100%. This probability, and the amount of water consumed, depend on how many living trees (natural or artificial) are in the same chunk, up to a maximum of 50 trees. There is no benefit to placing multiple forestries in the same chunk.
chrome-forestry=Twice as fast as an iron forestry, but requires fertiliser and carbon dioxide, and produces oxygen as a byproduct. Every 6 seconds, a chrome forestry will consume 15-30 fertiliser and 15-30 carbon dioxide, to produce 15-30 oxygen and up to 1 wood item, with a probability ranging from 0% to 100%. This probability, and the amount of fluid consumed and produced, depend on how many living trees (natural or artificial) are in the same chunk, up to a maximum of 50 trees. There is no benefit to placing multiple forestries in the same chunk.


; Filling stations
steam-barrelling-machine=Fills or empties steam cells and steam canisters. Does not require power. Use __CONTROL__ir-entity-adjustment__ to toggle between filling and emptying modes. Time taken is 1 second for copper steam cells, or 2 seconds for iron steam canisters.
barrelling-machine=Fills or empties barrels and canisters. Use __CONTROL__ir-entity-adjustment__ to toggle between filling and emptying modes. Time taken is 4 seconds for barrels, 2 seconds for canisters, or 1 second for copper steam cells.

; Ice melters.
; Recipe is 5 sec, 5 ice => 50 water, 25 steam. So it consumes 1/sec ice to produce 10/sec water and 5/sec steam.
copper-ice-melter=Melts 1 ice per second, to produce 10 water and 5 steam per second. Consumes burnable solid fuel.
electric-ice-melter=Melts 2 ice per second, to produce 20 water and 10 steam per second.
iron-ice-melter=Melts 4 ice per second, to produce 40 water and 20 steam per second. Consumes burnable solid fuel.

; Ancient wall produces multiple stone, but looks like it only gives 0-1 because of a bug with floating text. Seems it's a bug in base Factorio.
ancient-wall=[font=default-bold][color=#f7e2c2]Expected resources:[/color][/font]  2-4 [img=item/stone] Stone

; Powered pumps
copper-pump=Burns 300kW of solid fuel to pump 180/sec water.
offshore-pump=Uses 600kW electricity to pump 540/sec water.

; For locomotives, append some explanation of the differences.
steam-locomotive-extra= Fuelled by steam cells or raw burnable material. Cannot use canisters/barrels of liquid fuel.
steel-locomotive-extra= Accelerates faster than the iron locomotive, with better fuel efficiency, and accepts a wider variety of fuels. Fuelled by steam cells, raw burnable material, barrels/canisters of liquid fuel, or batteries.

; Vehicles
heavy-picket=Advanced hovering utility vehicle, ideal for mobile construction or fast transportation. Travels over land and sea, at speeds exceeding 400km/h. Large inventory size and equipment grid. Immune to impact damage, and can harvest trees, rocks, and items on the ground by moving over them. Does not carry weapons. Battery-powered.
heavy-roller=Heavy, slow vehicle for base construction and manual resource-hauling. Large inventory size and medium equipment grid. Almost immune to impact damage, and can harvest trees and items on the ground by driving over them. However, its lack of weaponry and maneuverability make it ill-suited for attacking enemy nests. Fuelled by steam cells, raw burnable material, or barrels/canisters of liquid fuel.
monowheel=Small, fast vehicle for transportation and exploration. Minimal cargo space, no weapons. Powered by steam cells.
cargo_ship=Large, slow-moving ship for transporting resources over sea. Placed on waterways. Fuelled by any burnable fuel, including barrels or canisters of liquid fuel, or by batteries.
boat=Fast-moving boat for personal travel or small-scale resource transportation over sea. Fuelled by any burnable fuel, including barrels or canisters of liquid fuel. Can be placed on waterways or on open sea.
ironclad=Fast steel-plated boat armed with a long-range mortar and cannon, for besieging enemy nests and claiming territory. The ironclad cannot be used for automatic shipping along waterways, unlike the boat and cargo ship. Fuelled by barrels or canisters of liquid fuel.
tank=Heavy combat vehicle armed with cannon, machine gun, and flamethrower. Fuelled by barrels or canisters of liquid fuel.
car=Versatile vehicle for personal transportation and assaulting enemy nests. Fuelled by barrels or canisters of liquid fuel.
hydrogen-airship=Slow-moving airship which can autonomously transport small amounts of cargo over land and sea. Can be piloted manually, or directed by the vehicle remote, or automatically follow schedules between airship stations. Low fuel consumption. Fuelled by barrels or canisters of liquid fuel. Explodes violently when destroyed.
helium-airship=An upgrade to the hydrogen airship, with a larger cargo hold and more nimble movement. Powered by batteries, or by barrels or canisters of liquid fuel.

seismic-scanner=Scans an entire landmass by mapping seismic waves produced by explosions. Consumes [img=item/explosives] explosives to operate. Produces significant pollution. Can be built on any land, including frigid terrain.\n\nMultiple seismic scanners on the same chunk will scan together at twice the speed. Seismic scanners placed in separate chunks will conduct separate scans. Once a seismic scan has been completed, seismic scanners in that chunk will deactivate.

; Editing IR3 furnace descriptions
stone-furnace=Smelts copper, tin, gold, lead, and scrap. Cannot smelt iron or steel. Consumes solid burnable fuels.
bronze-furnace=Smelts all ores, all pure minerals (except chromium), and all scrap (except steel). Consumes solid burnable fuels. Compared to the stone furnace, the bronze furnace is twice as fast, with lower fuel consumption and pollution per product.
electric-furnace=Smelts any ore, minerals, scrap, or graphite. The electric furnace has the same pollution, energy consumption, and speed as the bronze furnace, but doesn't require burnable fuel and can smelt more materials.
steel-furnace=Smelts any ore, minerals, scrap, or graphite. Consumes natural gas. Compared to the electric furnace, the gas furnace has much greater fuel efficiency.
; steel-furnace ID is used for the gas furnace.
;arc-furnace=Advanced electric furnace. Produces molten metals for casting or alloying. Manual recipe selection required. -- Leaving unchanged.
;blast-furnace=Combustion furnace. Processes steel, iron, copper, and silicon. Requires coke as fuel. Built-in speed and production bonuses. Requires compressed air to be piped in before items can be inserted. -- Leaving unchanged.
stone-alloy-furnace=Produces bronze or glass. Manual recipe selection required. Consumes solid burnable fuels.
bronze-alloy-furnace=Produces bronze, glass, or brass. Manual recipe selection required. Compared to the stone alloy furnace, the bronze alloy furnace is twice as fast, with lower fuel consumption and pollution per product.
electric-alloy-furnace=Produces steel, steel foam, brass, silicon, silicon carbide, bronze, or glass. The electric alloy furnace has the same pollution, energy consumption, and speed as the bronze alloy furnace, but doesn't require burnable fuel and can smelt more materials.

; Descriptions for all fissures, describing what they're useful for.
immateria-fissure=From this fissure seeps immateria, a blood-red vapor so ephemeral that it resists all attempts at containment by barrel or canister. It must be used where it is found, as there is no way to transport it in trains, ships, or airships.
dirty-steam-fissure=Produces polluted steam which can be harvested with an electric derrick and then used by a geothermal exchanger to produce clean steam. The amount of polluted steam produced fluctuates cyclically between 120/sec and 0/sec, with an average of 60/sec. Harvesting the fissure will not cause any reduction in yield over the long term. A proper geothermal setup can be expected to produce an average of 1.5MW of net electric power per fissure, fluctuating between zero and 3MW.
fossil-gas-fissure=Produces fossil gas, which is natural gas mixed with small amounts of helium and nitrogen. Can be harvested with a derrick and then separated out by a cryogenic plant. The primary product, natural gas, can be used to fuel petrochemical generators, gas furnaces, or vehicles. The amount of fossil gas produced by the fissure fluctuates cyclically between 120/sec and 0/sec, with an average of 60/sec. Harvesting the fissure will not cause any reduction in yield over the long term.
sulphur-gas-fissure=Produces sour gas, which can be harvested with a derrick and processed to yield sulphur, water, and carbon dioxide. The amount of sour gas produced by the fissure fluctuates cyclically between 120/sec and 0/sec, with an average of 60/sec. Harvesting the fissure will not cause any reduction in yield over the long term.
steam-fissure=Produces clean steam, which can be harvested with a derrick. The amount of steam produced by the fissure fluctuates cyclically between 120/sec and 0/sec, with an average of 60/sec. Harvesting the fissure will not cause any reduction in yield over the long term.

; For long-range delivery drones
long-range-delivery-drone-depot=Holds both long-range delivery drones and cargo items. When a drone dropoff makes a request for items stored in the dispatcher, a drone will be dispatched to deliver those items to the dropoff point. Also functions as a logistic requester chest.
long-range-delivery-drone-request-depot=Requests deliveries from drone dispatchers. There is no limit on delivery range. Also functions as a logistic buffer chest.

; For beacon rebalance
beacon=Holds 2 modules, whose effects are applied at 50% strength to all machines in the beacon's 7x7 area of effect. A machine can only be boosted by one beacon, otherwise it will become overloaded and stop working.
beacon2=Holds 2 modules, whose effects are applied at 100% strength to all machines in the beacon's 13x13 area of effect. A machine can only be boosted by one beacon, otherwise it will become overloaded and stop working.

medium-electric-pole=The same range as the bronze and iron poles, but cheaper in materials.

; Mining drills
burner-mining-drill=Miner powered by solid burnable fuels. Slightly higher power consumption than the steam-powered equivalent. Cannot mine ores which require a fluid input, namely gold and uranium.
steam-drill=Connects to steam pipes only. Mines at the same rate as the burner miner, but with 40% lower power consumption, and half the pollution. Cannot mine ores which require a fluid input, namely gold and uranium.
electric-mining-drill=Compared to the steam-powered miner, the electric mining drill has the same power consumption and pollution, per item produced. However, it produces twice as many items per second, and can take a fluid input, allowing it to mine gold and uranium. It mines from a larger area than the steam miner, but takes up the same amount of space.
chrome-drill=Compared to the smaller electric drill, the advanced mining drill produces double as many items per occupied tile, despite taking up more space. It also has 25% lower energy consumption and pollution per item produced.
