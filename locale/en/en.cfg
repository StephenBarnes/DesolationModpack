Desolation-complex-sliders=For debugging. If enabled, Desolation will create several map-gen sliders that allow you to modify the terrain generation, for example by changing the lengths of land arcs or the presence of surrounding islands. Enabling these sliders may slow down terrain generation.
Desolation-modify-vehicle-inventories=If checked, use the settings below to modify the sizes of vehicle inventories. If not checked, the settings below have no effect. It is recommended to leave these settings at their default values, much lower than vanilla, to maintain balance with the container-packing system.
Desolation-modify-stack-sizes=If checked, use the settings below to modify the stack sizes of items. If not checked, the settings below have no effect. It is recommended to leave these settings at their default values, to maintain balance with the container-packing system.
Desolation-unminable-vehicles=Applies to cars, tanks, monowheels, rollers, airships, boats, spidertrons, and all other car-like or spidertron-like vehicles. Does not apply to locomotives, wagons, or locomotive-like vehicles like big cargo ships.
Desolation-unminable-trains=Applies to all locomotives, wagons, and locomotive-like vehicles like big cargo ships that travel on waterways.
Desolation-stack-size-shotgunAmmo=It is recommended to leave this at a low value, to encourage building a belt to feed ammo to turrets.

Immune to impact damage, and can harvest trees, rocks, and items on the ground by moving over them. Does not carry weapons. Battery-powered.
heavy-roller=Heavy, slow vehicle for base construction and manual resource-hauling. Large inventory size and medium equipment grid. Almost immune to impact damage, and can harvest trees and items on the ground by driving over them. However, its lack of weaponry and maneuverability make it ill-suited for attacking enemy nests. Fuelled by steam cells, raw burnable material, or barrels/canisters of liquid fuel.
monowheel=Small, fast vehicle for transportation and exploration. Minimal cargo space, no weapons. Powered by steam cells.
cargo_ship=Large, slow-moving ship for transporting resources over sea. Placed on waterways. Fuelled by any burnable fuel, including barrels or canisters of liquid fuel, or by batteries.
boat=Fast-moving boat for personal travel or small-scale resource transportation over sea. Fuelled by any burnable fuel, including barrels or canisters of liquid fuel. Can be placed on waterways or on open sea.
ironclad=Fast steel-plated boat armed with a long-range mortar and cannon, for besieging enemy nests and claiming territory. The ironclad cannot be used for automatic shipping along waterways, unlike the boat and cargo ship. Fuelled by barrels or canisters of liquid fuel.
tank=Heavy combat vehicle armed with cannon, machine gun, and flamethrower. Fuelled by barrels or canisters of liquid fuel.
car=Versatile vehicle for personal transportation and assaulting enemy nests. Fuelled by barrels or canisters of liquid fuel.
hydrogen-airship=Slow-moving airship which can autonomously transport small amounts of cargo over land and sea. Can be piloted manually, or directed by the vehicle remote, or automatically follow schedules between airship stations. Low fuel consumption. Fuelled by barrels or canisters of liquid fuel. Explodes violently when destroyed.
helium-airship=An upgrade to the hydrogen airship, with a larger cargo hold and more nimble movement. Powered by batteries, or by barrels or canisters of liquid fuel.
