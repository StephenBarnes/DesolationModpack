-- Modify stack size and contents of barrels and canisters?
-- Copper canisters hold 100 steam and have stack size 50, so 5000/stack, or 400k/cargowagon.
-- Iron canisters hold 30 fluid and have stack size 50, so 1500/stack, or 120k/cargowagon. Researched soon after iron+electricity. Made from iron. Holds only petroleum and steam.
-- Barrels contain 60 fluid and have stack size 10, so 600/stack, or 48k/cargowagon. Researched right after steel. Made from steel. Holds petroleum and most liquids.
-- High-pressure canisters hold 80 fluid and have stack size 10, so 800/stack, or 64k/cargowagon. Research comes later than barrels. Made from steel and nanoglass. Holds gases. No need to change this since nothing else transports all those gases, except fluid wagons.
-- Fluid wagon holds 25k fluid. Cargo wagon holds 80 stacks.
-- So with the default settings:
-- * Transporting steam is best in copper canisters, but you could also use fluid wagons for simplicity, or barrels (since sending empty steam canisters back is a logistical problem), or even iron canisters (if you've got them moving around anyway for petroleum).
-- * Transporting petroleum is best in iron canisters, but you could also use fluid wagons for simplicity, or barrels (since sending empty iron canisters back is a logistical problem).
-- * Transporting most liquids is best in barrels (for double throughput) or fluid wagons (for simplicity).
-- * Transporting gases is best in high-pressure canisters (for 2.5x throughput) or fluid wagons (for simplicity).
-- In summary, I don't think anything here needs changing.

-- TODO review all this.
